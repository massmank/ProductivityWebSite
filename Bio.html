			<h2>About me</h2><br><br>
			<p> I am a senior at the University of St. Thomas majoring in Actuarial Science with minors in Computer Science and Mathmatical Statistics. I spent this summer in Newport Beach, California. 
				While in California I worked at Pacific Life as an Actuarial Intern. After graduating in the spring, I plan on pursuing a career in Actuarial Science starting as an Actuarial Analyst.
				At St. Thomas, I am also a member of the Varsity Softball team.</p>
			<h2>Tools Used</h2><br><br>
			<p>The first tool I used was HTML. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. The main use for HTML is the content of the web page. The basic text written in the web page and the images
				are all done in HTML. The second tool I used was JavaScript. With JavaScript, you can create a lot of functionality in the web page. The code for adding tasks to the to do list was all 
				done in JavaScript. Lastly, I used CSS for the styling of the web page. CSS stand for Cascading Style Sheet. The good thing about using CSS for styling is that if you want to restyle
				the web page you can just recode the CSS instead of the entire web page. The CSS contains code for everything from the web page background color to the hover highlight for the thumbnails 
				in the photo gallery.</p>
